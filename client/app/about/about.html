    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>On <a href="https://npmjs.com">npmjs.com</a> you are able to find packages. But I found no way to compare several packages with the same keyword by users (npm stars), github stars and github forks.</p>
    <p>So I wrote this small app based on nodejs, angularjs and mongoose/mongodb to compare different packages with the same keyword.</p>

    <p>Contribution is welcome. A live version is available on <a href="http://www.npcjs.io">npcjs.io</a>.</p>

    <h2>What could a user do</h2>
    <p>Just search by keyword exact one keyword and sort. If the data is older than 24h, it will be updated. Maybe a second search might be necessary.</p>

    <h2>What could an admin do (feature)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Force some updates.</li>
        <li>Configure github credentials if there is a need to (see github API limits).</li>
        <li>Create other admin accounts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How it works in a nutshell</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Check npmjs.com if there are packages with the given keyword.
        </li>

        <li>
            Check the results if there are any links to github.com
        </li>
        <li>
            Return the data back to you.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>And yes: The data is cached on the server.</p>
