    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>On npmjs.com you are able to find packages. But I found no way to compare several packages with the same keyword by users (npm stars), github stars and github forks.</p>
    <p>So I wrote this small app based on nodejs, angularjs and mongoose/mongodb to compare different packages with the same keyword.</p>
    <p>Contribution is welcome. A live version will come soon.</p>
    <h1>What could a user do</h1>
    <p>Just search by keyword exact one keyword and sort. If the data is older than 24h, it will be updated. Maybe a second search might be necessary.</p>
    <h1>What could an admin do (feature)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Force some updates.</li>
        <li>Configure github credentials if there is a need to (see github API limits).</li>
        <li>Create other admin accounts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Currently, I see no benefit for a user to have an account.</p>
