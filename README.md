# Node Package Comperator
## About

On [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) you are able to find packages. 
But I found no way to compare several packages with the same keyword by users (npm stars), 
github stars and github forkes.

So I wrote this small app based on nodejs, angularjs and mongoose/mongodb to 
compare differnt packages with the same keyword.

Contribution is welcome. A live version will come soon.
