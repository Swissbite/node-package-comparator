# Node Package Comperator
## About

On [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) you are able to find packages. 
But I found no way to compare several packages with the same keyword by users (npm stars), 
github stars and github forkes.

So I wrote this small app based on nodejs, angularjs and mongoose/mongodb to 
compare differnt packages with the same keyword.

Contribution is welcome. A live version will come soon.

## What could a user do
Just search by keyword exact one keyword and sort. If the data is older than 24h, it will be updated. Maybe a second search might be necessary.

## What could an admin do
- Force some updates.
- Configure githup creditals if there is a need to (see github API limits).
- Create other admin accounts.

Currently, I see no benefit for a user to have an account.
