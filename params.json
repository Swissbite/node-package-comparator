{"name":"Node Package Comparator","tagline":"","body":"# Node Package Comparator\r\n## About\r\n\r\nOn [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) you are able to find packages. \r\nBut I found no way to compare several packages with the same keyword by users (npm stars), \r\ngithub stars and github fork's.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote this small app based on nodejs, angularjs and mongoose/mongodb to \r\ncompare different packages with the same keyword.\r\n\r\nContribution is welcome.\r\n\r\n# Live version\r\nThe service can be found under [nodepackagecomparator-swissbite.rhcloud.com](https://nodepackagecomparator-swissbite.rhcloud.com).\r\n\r\n## What could a user do\r\nJust search by keyword exact one keyword and sort. If the data is older than 24h, it will be updated. Maybe a second search might be necessary.\r\n\r\n## What could an admin do (feature)\r\n- Force some updates.\r\n- Configure github credentials if there is a need to (see github API limits).\r\n- Create other admin accounts.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I see no benefit for a user to have an account.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nNode Package Comparator is licensed under [GNU Affero GPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
